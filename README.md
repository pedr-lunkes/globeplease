# Globe Please!
Welcome to GLOBE, Please!!, a project by Stardust Developers participating in the NASA Space Apps Hackathon. We are excited to present our game aimed at achieving the "GLOBE Protocols Game" challenge.

In GLOBE, Please!!, you take on the role of an evaluator responsible for analyzing GLOBE protocol reports submitted by individuals from around the globe. This educational game immerses players in the world of environmental science, encouraging them to identify errors in data and understand the significance of accurate environmental reporting.

Through engaging gameplay, we aim to raise awareness about climate issues while fostering a deeper understanding of the GLOBE protocols. Join us on this journey to make a positive impact on our planet!
